# Social Network Analysis : network of the AIMS-Senegal students at the restaurant

## Abstract 

A network can be a specialized type of mathematical graph or interconnected systems. Hence, it is not
far from a graph, which implies the visual representation of a set of nodes and edges. Network nodes
may represent web pages, people, organizations, articles, places, and many other things. Networks in
real world fall into one of the following four major types : Information networks, Technological networks,
Biological networks, Social networks.
Most of these networks are very complex. It therefore requires a detailed analysis for its understanding.
In this work, we analyzed the case of a social network; this network is the network of AIMS Senegal
students when they eat out (each student chose two of these friends with whom they prefer to eat at
the table). We analyzed the topology and also analyzed Degree Distribution , Density, Eccentricity ,
Wiener index , Clustering Coefficient and Community Detection by using the python library networkx.
Weâ€™ve put the data and codes in this remote github repository : https://github.com/osiastossou/SocialNetworkRestaurantAIMSstudents2020.git
